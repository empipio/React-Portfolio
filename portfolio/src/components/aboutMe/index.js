          Welcome! I am a trainee developer living in Cheshire, UK. I spent
          seven years as a small animal veterinary surgeon before enrolling in
          the University of Birmingham's boot camp! In my spare time I enjoy
          yoga, reading and exploring the Peak District with my rescue dog,
          Jack.
